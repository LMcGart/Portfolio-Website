        <p class="contents" id="proj_text">
          The objective of this project was to redesign University of Michigan's
          course enrollment system, commonly referred to as "backpacking," in
          order to streamline the process, making it more efficient and
          user-friendly. I talked to students to better understand what
          struggles they faced when backpacking and if they experienced the same
          difficulties that I faced. Using their comments as the foundation for
          my design changes I performed a redesign over two weeks. The design I
          came up with reduced the number of pages, added new functionality, and
          overhauled the user interface to be easier for users to understand the
          page contents while remaining within university guidelines.

        <h1 class="section_headings">The Problem</h1>
        <p class="contents" id="problem_text">
          The current method of enrolling for classes at the University of
          Michigan leaves a lot to be desired. When talking to other students,
          they described it as confusing, stressful, overwhelming, and
          convoluted, just to name a few a few of the problems. The layout of
          the content is confusing and there are many excess tabs that crowd the
          page and slow down the process of picking, replacing, or deleting
          classes. Additionally, it is hard to navigate between the pages and
          students often find themselves getting lost trying to find the
          resources they need. Below our my proposed design changes to combat
          these issues.

      <div class="boxes" id="solution">
        <h1 class="section_headings">Proposed Solution</h1>
        <p class="contents" id="solution_text">
          My proposed solution overhauls the UI of the UofM course enrollment
          system while improving the user experience. It reduces the number of
          pages in the course enrollment section by 38% and reduces clicks by at
          least 55% on average through testing with other students. It also
          makes course searching more efficient, as multiple course criteria can
          be directly searched, which is not currently possible. Additionally,
          the redesign adds commonly used resources directly to the pages so
          that students don't have to switch tabs as often in order to reach
          their end goal. The redesign combines updated aesthetics and
          functionality to bring the old UofM enrollment system up to date with
          students' needs.

          While not changing much on the "Current Schedule Page," the redesigned
          page updates the interface, creating a cleaner look that is easier to
          follow. The user information is moved to the top left of the page to
          keep the focus on classes in the center of the page while making it
          less clustered. The navigation bar at the top is also cleaned up,
          getting rid of the additional tabs which are found to be unnecessary
          given the update to the next page shown below. Finally, the class
          cards are moved to the center of the screen to take a more natural
          position and are updated with a modern look. One minor update is to
          the "Class Schedule Filter Options" section which has been changed
          from a checkbox and then filter system to a click to apply button,
          reducing the number of clicks from two to one.

          The bulk of the changes are made to this page. Starting on the left
          side, there is now an option to search for a class based on number,
          name, or subject/number directly from the "Add Classes" page. This
          allows for a quick search instead of being brought to a separate
          search page and then having to search from there. In case more
          specifiers are needed, there is an option to go to an advanced search
          page. Moving to the backpacked classes cards, additional functionality
          has been added. Now, on the right side of the card, users are able to
          opt in for the waitlist or time conflict override without having to go
          through the edit class process again. Also, next to each class card,
          the option to add, delete, swap, or edit a class has been added
          directly to the page. Previously, each of these options were separate
          tabs in the navigation bar that would bring you to separate pages
          where you could only then make changes to your classes. Now, the
          changes a user needs to make can all be done from one page. Each class
          card also includes a link to the Atlas page of that class so users can
          view class statistics directly from the backpack instead of having to
          go to the Atlas website and then searching for their class there. Many
          students I talked to valued simplicity and convenience during the
          course enrollment process in order to reduce stress and confusion. The
          updates above directly target these issues by streamlining the process
          through the addition of buttons that make all changes a student could
          need to make available from one page while relocating other resources
          that previously crowded the page.

          The updated search page allows users the option to make a quick search
          or refined search. The basic functionality remains the same but
          through the refined option users can now search based on credit hours,
          distribution requirement, and/or skills requirement. The resources
          that were previously hidden under the "Additional Search Criteria"
          dropdown are now available from first glance. The goal of these
          changes were to give users all of the resources they need to find
          fitting classes from one page instead of having to refer back and
          forth between course guides and the class search page.

          Over the course of this project I learned how to use Figma and perform
          a redesign based on user feedback. Taking into account other students
          and my struggles with the UofM course enrollment process, I spent time
          critiquing and making design changes that would increase functionality
          while reducing clutter. This was my first time using Figma and I
          learned how to go from idea to design, going through multiple
          iterations to create a clean final product. I learned the value of
          auto-layouts and components in order to expedite the design process.
          Overall, it was a valuable learning experience that taught me Figma
          and an introduction to an end-to-end UX design process.
