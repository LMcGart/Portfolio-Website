          Over the course of this project I worked on a team of 5 consultants in
          collaboration with the School of Kinesiology at the University of
          Michigan. Our role was to make design suggestions for the current
          Michigan Model for Health and InPact websites. These websites house
          much of the physical education curriculum for the state of Michigan.
          Over the course of the project we had weekly team and client meetings
          in order to stay on track and meet deadlines. To back our suggestions,
          we interviewed teachers and health-coordinators from around the state
          to better understand what the current websites did, and didn't, do
          well. Our final deliverable consisted of a write-up describing our
          design suggestions and why we made them. We also included a figma
          mock-up of the design changes we were proposing the clients add to
          their InPact website. I was responsible for interviews and designing
          the figma mock-up. It was an amazing learning experience that taught
          me hands-on the UX design process from start to finish. For more
