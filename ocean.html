          The Ocean Keyboard was an extension of my business, Ocean Keys, which
          I started over the pandemic. Originally, I was importing mechanical
          keyboard parts and selling them to customers all across the United
          States. Over time I got more involved in the mechanical keyboard
          community and decided to start designing and building my own keyboard
          to fill a gap in the available product supply.

        <h1 class="section_headings">The Problem</h1>
        <p class="contents" id="problem_text">
          When I started this project, the custom mechanical keyboard scene was
          very hard to get into. It was extremely expensive with budget keyboard
          options starting at around $250 fully built. Parts were also hard to
          source and the build process was confusing to beginners. Also, the
          budget keyboard options were either very plasticky or used a PCB
          mounting system that was not optimal, creating lackluster keystroke
          sounds, one of the most sought after qualities from hobbyists. My end
          goal with the Ocean Keyboard was to make a keyboard kit that was
          accessible and affordable for all. As I'll talk about further below, I
          started out creating the Ocean Keyboard using stacked pieces of
          lasercut acrylic. After designing and going through a few iterations
          of this first prototype, I began working on a version of the keyboard
          that was built using an SLA 3D printer.

      <div class="boxes" id="solution">
        <h1 class="section_headings">Proposed Solution</h1>
        <p class="contents" id="solution_text">
          At the time of building, most custom keyboards utilized a clamshell
          design where the top and bottom cases would be tightened together
          using screws. Even many of the 3D printed or acrylic keyboards used
          screws, potentially leading to thread stripping issues that would ruin
          the keyboard. The Ocean Keyboard introduces a first-of-kind magnetic
          mounting system that connects the top and bottom cases together using
          magnets. This negates potential threading issues, makes parts easily
          replaceable, and creates an easy and approachable build process.
          Additionally, using an SLA 3D printer creates an affordable keyboard
          case with a high quality finish.

          The Ocean Keyboard started off with a layered acrylic sheet
          construction. I designed the layers using a 2D software, Inkscape, and
          cut them out at a local makerspace using a laser cutter. I went
          through many design iterations in order to get the tolerances and
          alignment correct. When I got everything right, I glued the layers
          together and everything worked properly and the keyboard sounded
          great. However, gluing all of the layers together was not a scaleable
          process, and as I wanted to bring it to the market eventually, I had
          to think of another way to do it. I tried heat-set inserts and screws
          to keep the layers together but it warped the acrylic. To create a
          more premium product, I explored SLA 3D printing and found that to be
          the direction I wanted to go in.

          SLA printing would allow me to create a top and bottom case that were
          each one solid piece, unlike the many layered acrylic prototype I
          previously created. To create the product I desired, I learned CAD
          using Autodesk Fusion 360. I spent some time iterating the design and
          making sure the dimensions and tolerances were correct and then I
          moved into the prototyping phase. The pictures above, as well as the
          first image on this page, are renders of the design I created. I
          wanted it to be a clean, simple, and elegant keyboard in order to
          appeal to as large of an audience as possible.

          I began prototyping using an Anycubic Photon M3 Max but as seen above,
          the results were far from satisfactory. I went back to my designs and
          iterated them quite a few more times but I was still unable to create
          a product that I was satisfied with. Throughout the process I was
          reminded that things rarely ever go right on the first try. At this
          point, I had to go back to school and could not bring the printer with
          me so the project was put on pause.

          While I was initially disappointed and felt that the whole project was
          a waste of time, money and resources, I realized it was an enriching
          learning experience. I gained a significant amount of knowledge
          covering 2D design software, CAD, laser cutters, and 3D printers.
          Perhaps my biggest learning was that going from a viable design to a
          usable product is a very long and complicated process that requires
          many iterations and adjustments to get right. I still believe my
          design is scaleable and I will continue to work on the keyboard and
          finish this project.
