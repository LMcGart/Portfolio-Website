          The Ocean Keyboard was an extension of my business, Ocean Keys, which
          I started over the pandemic. Originally, I was importing mechanical
          keyboard parts and selling them to customers all across the United
          States. Over time I got more involved in the mechanical keyboard
          community and decided to start designing and building my own keyboard
          to fill a gap in the hobby that I thought needed to be filled.

        <h1 class="section_headings">The Problem</h1>
        <p class="contents" id="problem_text">
          When I started this project, the custom mechanical keyboard scene was
          very hard to get into. It was extremely expensive with budget keyboard
          options starting at around $250 fully built. Parts were also hard to
          source and the build process was confusing to beginners. Also, the
          budget keyboard options were either very plasticky or used a PCB
          mounting system that was not optimal, creating lackluster keystroke
          sounds, one of the most sought after qualities from hobbyists. My end
          goal with the Ocean Keyboard was to make a keyboard kit that was
          accessible and affordable for all. As I'll talk about further below, I
          started out creating the Ocean Keyboard using stacked pieces of
          lasercut acrylic. After designing and going through a few iterations
          of this first prototype, I began working on a version of the keyboard
          that was built using an SLA 3D printer.

        <h1 class="section_headings">Proposed Solution</h1>
        <p class="contents" id="solution_text">
          At the time of building, most custom keyboards utilized a clamshell
          design where the top and bottom cases would be tightened together
          using screws. Even many of the 3D printed or acrylic keyboards used
          screws, potentially leading to thread stripping issues that would ruin
          the keyboard. The Ocean Keyboard introduces a first-of-kind magnetic
          mounting system that connects the top and bottom cases together using
          magnets. This negates potential threading issues, makes parts easily
          replaceable, and creates an easy and approachable build process.
          Additionally, using an SLA 3D printe creates an affordable, yet
          quality, keyboard case.
